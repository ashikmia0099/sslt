                    The journey of communication, hearing, and swallowing healthcare in Bangladesh took a significant leap forward in 2004 when the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Dhaka, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Health Professions Institute (BHPI) — the academic arm of the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed (CRP) — introduced the first-ever 5-year Bachelor of Science program in the field. This program, modeled after the curriculum of University College London (UCL), aimed to train professionals in addressing the increasing demand for skilled practitioners in communication and hearing healthcare.
                    
                    This milestone program marked a critical turning point, with the first cohort of qualified professionals entering the healthcare sector. These professionals faced multiple challenges, including the prevalence of malpractice and the pressing need for defined standards in education, clinical practice, and research. These challenges emphasized the necessity for a regulatory body to oversee professional standards, guide clinical practices, and encourage continuous development within the field of communication, hearing, and swallowing disorders.
                    
                    
                    In response to these challenges, the founding of the Society of Speech & Language Therapists (SSLT) became a key moment in the professional history of Bangladesh. SSLT took on the responsibility of maintaining high standards in education, advocating for ethical practices, and fostering innovation in the treatment of communication, hearing, and swallowing impairments. The Society has played an instrumental role in providing ongoing professional development, raising awareness, and creating a cohesive community for all healthcare professionals working in this multidisciplinary field.
